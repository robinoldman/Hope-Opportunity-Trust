                    <p>Our success has given us the momentum and motivation to do more. To change more lives and create
                        more opportunities for our young people. To that end, we have identified seven key
                        opportunities, but to make them happen, we need to raise new independent funding. This would
                        enable us to extend and enrich our work, impacting even more young people and their communities.
                        We are asking for your support to make this happen.<br><br>

                    <h4>3 Parent mentoring programme </h4>
                    <p>We have recognised the need to support families and guardians from the beginning of this bursary
                        process. It is an investment vital to the boarding programme's success, recognising that many
                        parents have difficulty adjusting and giving their children the space and support to take
                        advantage of this life-changing educational opportunity.


                        <br><br>
                        We know from experience that close collaboration with all parties helps minimise the risk of the
                        “pull” from parents and the wider home community to “stick to what they are familiar with”
                        Without this support, parents can struggle to overcome their concerns about losing their child
                        to a world they are unfamiliar with and unsure how to support their child within it. For this to
                        succeed, it needs resourcing beyond the volunteer support that is currently available.

                        <br><br>
                        We want to develop a parent mentoring programme that mirrors the successful student mentoring
                        programme, thereby linking new parents with mentors whose children have been through the process
                        and are now employed.

                        important in serving students adjusting to radically new and challenging life circumstances.
                        Helping to develop personal resilience, countering imposter syndrome, and dispelling the

                        However, we have also learned an unmet need for more personalised and profound confidential
                        support for students with specific problems and challenges. We have trialled this form of
                        personalised support recently with a package of seven sessions, which proved highly successful.
                        When required, we will need a designated reserve to support up to eight students, a year, to
                        extend this pilot into a permanent support service.
