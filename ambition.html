                    <h3>Ambitions</h3>
                    <h4>Our success to date has given us the momentum and motivation to do more. To change more lives and create more opportunities for our young people. 
                        To that end, we have identified seven key opportunities, but to make them happen we need to raise new independent funding.
                        This would enable us to extend and enrich our work impacting on even more young people and their communities. 
                        We are asking for your support to make this happen. <br><br>
                        
                        We have a detailed and cost-effective budget that will enable us to deliver on our seven key opportunities. 
                        The total budget of circa £537.5k over 5 years will ensure the expansion and sustainability of the programme. 
                        and is a more than reasonable cost, balanced against the £2 million of "in kind" investment in students that we will generate over the same period.
                        <br><br>
                        The new funding and programmes will enable us to increase and develop life-changing opportunities for more young people and ensure our staff can extend the necessary support to families and communities to raise their levels of aspiration and achievement. 
                        <br><br>
                        The seven key opportunities for expanding our impact are;

                    <h4>In an academic sense, Marlborough has provided a lot of inspiration which has helped me to determine what I want to do later in life. For example, a talk given by Dr. Chiara Marletto earlier this year about quantum gravity has sparked my interest in more complex branches of quantum and classical physics.<br><br>Another talk, this one given by a pupil in my school who has taught himself relativity, was also a great joy to attend. It sticks in my mind as a great example of the supportive and collaborative nature of this subject at its best, which I hope to experience more widely in the years to come when I study physics at university.<br><br>Through living in and studying at Marlborough, my confidence has increased immeasurably and has taught me that no aspiration is too high, as long as I work hard enough for it</h4>
