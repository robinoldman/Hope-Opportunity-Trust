                        I've lived pretty much in the same area my entire life.
                        If you stay here, you're gonna sort of end up in the same
                        cycle. <br><br> When I was younger, there was a chance I wasn't
                        oing to walk. I was in and out of hospital a lot. I've had,
                        I think, we're nearing on 10 surgeries now.

                        I really, really want to come back and work in the
                        community that I live in eventually. Like a really big goal
                        of mine was to be successful, a charity for children of
                        domestic abuse, like the situation that I came from. <br><br>
                        Throwing yourself in the deep end is the only way you're
                        going to know if you can
                        swim. Go for it, say yes to absolutely everything.
