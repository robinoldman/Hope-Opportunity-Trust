                    <h1>Ambitions</h1>
                    <p>Our success to date has given us the momentum and motivation to do more. To change more lives
                        and create more opportunities for our young people.
                        To that end, we have identified seven key opportunities, but to make them happen we need to
                        raise new independent funding.
                        This would enable us to extend and enrich our work impacting on even more young people and their
                        communities.
                        We are asking for your support to make this happen. <br><br>

                        We have a detailed and cost-effective budget that will enable us to deliver on our seven key
                        opportunities.
                        The total budget of circa £537.5k over 5 years will ensure the expansion and sustainability of
                        the programme.
                        and is a more than reasonable cost, balanced against the £2 million of "in kind" investment in
                        students that we will generate over the same period.
                        <br><br>
                        The new funding and programmes will enable us to increase and develop life-changing
                        opportunities for more young people and ensure our staff can extend the necessary support to
                        families and communities to raise their levels of aspiration and achievement.

                        community .</h4>
                    <p>Collaborating with DLA Piper, a national firm of solicitors, and the Crown Prosecution Service,
                        we have been given access to fully funded apprenticeships and supported university places for
                        students who wish to pursue a career in the legal profession.
                        <br><br>
                        We have also been approached to deliver apprenticeships for the BBC, LA Productions, and the

                        <br><br>
                        Whilst we can distribute the places, it is vitally important that we can fully support the
                        students throughout the apprenticeship programme to ensure their success. This will take an

                    <h4>3 Parent mentoring programme </h4>
                    <p>From the very beginning, we have recognised the need to support families and guardians.
                        It is an investment that is vital to the success of the boarding programme, recognising
                        that many parents have difficulty adjusting and giving their children the space and
                        support to take advantage of this life-changing educational opportunity.
                        <br><br>
                        We know from experience that close collaboration with all parties helps minimise the risk
                        of the “pull” from parents and the wider home community to “stick to what they are familiar
                        with” Without this support, parents can struggle to overcome their concerns about losing
                        their child to a world they are unfamiliar with and unsure how to support their child within it.
                        For this to succeed it needs resourcing beyond the volunteer support that is currently
                        available.
                        <br><br>
                        We want to develop a parent mentoring programme that mirrors the existing successful student
                        mentoring programme, thereby linking new parents with mentors whose children have been through
                        the process and are now in employment.

                    <h4>4 - Aspire and engage programme </h4>
                    <p>We aim to increase the number of students receiving bursaries through HOT and its partners
                        through the creation of the
                        “Aspire and Engage” mentoring programme for Year 9 students that will support them to widen
                        their horizons, raise and
                        realise their ambitions and discover their self-worth.
                        <br><br>
                        By connecting them with mentors and role models from a wide range of professions we want to
                        inspire and empower boys
                        and girls from the least advantaged communities to develop the capacity to shape their world and
                        their future by challenging
                        stereotypes and expectations. In particular, we want to ensure boys see that their futures are
                        not limited by their gender,
                        ethnicity, background, parental income or expectation.
                        <br><br>
                        Successful candidates will receive nine 1:1 mentor sessions and undertake two specific research
                        tasks throughout the year.
                        The impact of the programme will be measured by a quantifiable improvement in school performance
                        data, an increase in the
                        number of girls and boys gaining bursaries and good quality higher education places and other
                        education and employment pathways.

                    <h4>5 Impact assessment </h4>
                    <p>One of HOT’s unique strengths is its direct access to schools, and through them,
                        to the wider communities that they serve. <br><br>

                        We know anecdotally that there is a positive ripple effect from our work on student aspirations
                        in each of our 5
                        Member schools. This is not simply an incidental added value but is an integral
                        element in our model and philosophy. The HOT programme is about delivering change
                        and opportunity for students, our partner schools and their communities.
                        <br><br>
                        It is therefore vital that we can capture data and map impacts within a clear
                        research framework. However, we do not presently have the resources to adequately
                        and systematically achieve this. Designing the framework, researching, and
                        analysing data to present objective impact evidence is a task that will require a
                        new dedicated resource.

                    <h4>6 Student and alumni well-being coaching and support </h4>
                    <p>The work of our programme managers and the impact of the student mentoring
                        initiative has been vitally important in serving students adjusting to radically
                        new and challenging life circumstances. Helping to develop personal resilience,
                        countering imposter syndrome, and dispelling the understandable fear of the new,
                        are all areas where mentoring has proven hugely beneficial and successful.
                        <br><br>
                        However, we have also learned that there is an unmet need for a more personalised
                        and deeper form of confidential support for students dealing with specific
                        problems and challenges. We have trialled this form of personalised support
                        recently with a package of seven sessions which proved to be highly successful.
                        To extend this pilot into a permanent support service, we will need a designated
                        reserve that can offer support for up to eight students p.a. when required.

                    <h4>7 HOT consultancy services - developing our Intervention Offer </h4>
                    <p>A natural extension of HOT’s programme to broaden opportunities for more young people
                        could be achieved through the creation of a new consultancy arm to collaborate with
                        schools on initiatives to reduce the attainment gap based on our proven record of
                        success.
                        <br><br>
                        Narrowing the ever-increasing attainment gap between students from areas of social
                        disadvantage and their peers is a national challenge. The impact of Covid has increased
                        that gap. We have a proven model that is narrowing that gap and could therefore be a model for
                        school improvement beyond our partner schools. We want to share this good practice with other
                        schools and their communities but to do this we need your help. We have developed a wealth of
                        positive experience and a suite of good practice tools that can help raise aspirations in
                        schools, and the support processes to enable that. The consultancy would be a means of expanding
                        opportunities for schools and students, but would equally be a source of revenue for HOT helping
                        to sustain and underpin our core programmes.
                        <br><br>
                        Designing and marketing the consultancy model, including engagement with target
                        schools, and scoping the expertise and resources required, will need a development
                        budget and additional professional resources at the start-up stage.
