                <h4>I have always lived in Liverpool and grew up in the Kensington/Fairfield area, which was where I attended St. Francis of Assisi secondary school. 
                    My sister was the first member of our family to attend university and it was my aspiration to follow her lead.

                    <h4>oarding school has helped me in a number of different ways. Not only has it provided me with
                    an excellent school education, it has also educated me in other areas of life.  The most significant lesson that I took from the experience was that 
                    there are no aspirations too high for anyone and this has made me want to push myself to be as successful as possible in the future, something that 
                    I previously wouldnâ€™t have had the self-belief and confidence to do.<br><br> Despite all of this, one of the hardest things I learnt whilst at boarding school
                     was that success does not come easy or without hard work. Throughout my experience I had various setbacks and difficulties that I had to overcome.
