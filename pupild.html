It sticks in my mind as a great example of the supportive and collaborative nature of this subject at its best, which I hope to experience more widely in the years to come when I study physics at university.<br><br>Through living in and studying at Marlborough, my confidence has increased immeasurably and has taught me that no aspiration is too high, as long as I work hard enough for it</h4>
