                    <p>‘After spending most of my childhood in Hungary, I moved to Liverpool with my mum and brother due
                        to
                        challenging family circumstances. Settling in a new country has not always been easy – my mum
                        struggled to find employment when we first came to England but today now works as a care home
                        assistant, something that she loves. I have also, through perseverance, found a path that I
                        love. Soon
                        after I arrived, I sat an exam to apply to King’s Leadership Academy and I was lucky enough to
                        get in and
                        continue the next two years of my studies there. In my last year, I became a Prefect and made
                        friends
                        who I keep in contact with to this day. I loved being part of that community. It was this
                        school’s
                        partnership with the Royal National Children&#39;s SpringBoard Foundation that allowed me to
                        take the
                        opportunity of becoming a boarding school student at Marlborough College for my A-levels.​

                    <p>One particularly memorable trip from my experience of joining the RNCSF programme was a visit to
                        St.
                        Peter’s School in York where I got a feeling of what boarding schools are like. At the end of
                        this trip my
                        teacher from King’s Leadership also showed us around parts of the University of York. It was my
                        first time
                        seeing and being shown around a university, which inspired me to seek higher education and
                        aspire to
                        become the first person in my family to go to university

                    <p>The shift from studying at a state school to living in a boarding school four hours away from
                        home has
                        been a big change. However, it has allowed me to have opportunities - such as a trip to NASA -
                        which I
                        still think of as the best experience of my life. On top of that, I have made lifelong friends
                        at
                        Marlborough, not only in my boarding house with the girls I live with on a day-to-day basis, but
                        also with
                        my classmates and other pupils with whom I share numerous interests. I am the Head of Charities
                        and
                        Sustainability in my house and have organised fundraising events for a wide range of causes,
                        such as
                        Bobby’s Fund and Alzheimer’s Research UK. Since I am lucky to be supported by my school and the
                        Royal
                        National Children&#39;s SpringBoard Foundation, it is great to raise money for people who are
                        disadvantaged
                        because of different circumstances.

                    <p>In an academic sense, Marlborough has provided a lot of inspiration which has helped me to
                        determine
                        what I want to do later in life. For example, a talk given by Dr. Chiara Marletto earlier this
                        year about
                        quantum gravity has sparked my interest in more complex branches of quantum and classical
                        physics. It
                        was a privilege to be taught by a professional like Dr. Marletto and it was also an inspiration
                        to see a
                        woman on the frontline of scientific discovery. Another talk, this one given by a pupil in my
                        school who
                        has taught himself relativity, was also a great joy to attend. It was uplifting to share his
                        enthusiasm
                        about the subject, and it sticks in my mind as a great example of the supportive and
                        collaborative nature
                        of this subject at its best, which I hope to experience more widely in the years to come when I
                        study
                        physics at university.
