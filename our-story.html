                        talented students from estates labelled as “disadvantaged” would not flourish if given access to
                        schools such as Rugby, Cheltenham Ladies College and Eton.

                        one of a raft of opportunities we use to capture
                        the natural enthusiasm of our students and turn
                        it into aspiration so that our students can
                        reach their potential.<br><br> As well as the
                        life-changing benefits for the students involved,
                        we have seen the success we have had with the

                        school, and increasingly, students in our feeder
