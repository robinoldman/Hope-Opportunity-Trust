                    <p>The founding idea came from the CEO of a Cheshire-based housing association who saw no reason
                        talented students from estates labelled as “disadvantaged” would not flourish if given access to
                        schools such as Rugby, Cheltenham Ladies College and Eton.

                        held at Windsor Castle on 31st October 2012 with an aspiration to send at least one student to
                        Eton College.
