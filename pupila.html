                    <p>I've been able to experience life for what it is, which is a treasure box full of opportunities.
                        It just taught me so much about myself, about what I could be interested in,
                        and start building up all these worlds of possibilities. The confidence
                        I have in myself to know that my education, how my ability is, with
                        something someone saw that way within me was really great.
                        I grew up in Blacon, and if you speak to people outside of Blacon and ask
                        them their opinions on this place, usually you get quite negative comments.

                    <p>CI was pulled into the head teacher's office. He told me about
                        this opportunity Blacon High School had a partnership with
                        RNSCF. It was a nine-month process where I went on taster
                        visits to boarding schools. I went through an admissions
                        process at Glenalmond. I had to get five Bs at GCSE, and then
                        they placed you with the school. After that point, it was
                        brought to me the opportunity to potentially go to Eton.
                        The Opportunity Trust prepared me for that very well. I chose
                        economics at A-level in Peters, which wouldn't have been
                        available at Holly Lodge, so that was one thing that is a big
                        difference. I never would have picked what I was doing now
                        because I never would have had exposure to the things I'm
                        learning about now. It's quite a hard thing to think about
                        when you're 15. This transition from one place is completely
                        different from another.

                    <p>I was a little bit more homesick than I thought
                        I was going to be, but I was quite confident in
                        myself, and I knew that I would be able to maneuver
                        my way through. Try to express myself in as many
                        ways as possible.
                        When I went to boarding, I realized, you know,
                        it just sort of empowered me and involved me to
                        be who I am. When I got to Eton, I realized that
                        the world is my oyster. I was applying to schools
                        that I didn't even dream of applying to. I managed
                        to get a place at UCL, which is a top 10 university
                        in the world. I've just put myself in a position
                        where I've just ticked along, asked the right
                        questions, and met the right people at the right
                        times that has come to fruition.

                    <p>In terms of future aspirations, I'm in quite a
                        privileged position to be able to have options.
                        Art is something that I'm quite interested in,
                        and I've managed to secure an internship at the
                        Tate Gallery this summer as a curator.
                        You have the luxury of being able to choose from a
                        different range of fields about your experiences,
                        about in that way you think. That really opened my
                        mind to what life is really like.
