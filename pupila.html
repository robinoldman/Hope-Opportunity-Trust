            <h3>students A: How I came to Marlborough </h3>
            <h4>After spending most of my childhood in Hungary, I moved to Liverpool with my mum and brother due to
                challenging family circumstances. Settling in a new country has not always been easy – my mum
                struggled to find employment when we first came to England but today now works as a care home
                assistant, something that she loves. I have also, through perseverance, found a path that I love.<br><br>The shift from studying at a state school to living in a boarding school four hours away from home has
                been a big change. However, it has allowed me to have opportunities - such as a trip to NASA - which I
                still think of as the best experience of my life. <br><br>On top of that, I have made lifelong friends at
                Marlborough, not only in my boarding house with the girls I live with on a day-to-day basis, but also with
                my classmates and other pupils with whom I share numerous interests. I am the Head of Charities and
                Sustainability in my house and have organised fundraising events for a wide range of causes, such as
                Bobby’s Fund and Alzheimer’s Research UK. </h4>

                <h3>student A What I got from Marlborough. </h3>
                <h4> In an academic sense, Marlborough has provided a lot of inspiration which has helped me to determine
                    what I want to do later in life. For example, a talk given by Dr. Chiara Marletto earlier this year about
                    quantum gravity has sparked my interest in more complex branches of quantum and classical physics.<br><br>  Another talk, this one given by a pupil in my school who
                    has taught himself relativity, was also a great joy to attend. It sticks in my mind as a great example of the supportive and collaborative nature
                    of this subject at its best, which I hope to experience more widely in the years to come when I study
                    physics at university.<br><br>
                    Through living in and studying at Marlborough, my confidence has increased
                    immeasurably and has taught me that no aspiration is too high, as long as I work hard enough for it</h4>
