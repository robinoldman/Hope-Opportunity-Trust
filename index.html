            <h4>‘After spending most of my childhood in Hungary, I moved to Liverpool with my mum and brother due to
                challenging family circumstances. Settling in a new country has not always been easy – my mum
                struggled to find employment when we first came to England but today now works as a care home
                assistant, something that she loves. I have also, through perseverance, found a path that I love.The shift from studying at a state school to living in a boarding school four hours away from home has
                been a big change. However, it has allowed me to have opportunities - such as a trip to NASA - which I
                still think of as the best experience of my life. On top of that, I have made lifelong friends at
                Marlborough, not only in my boarding house with the girls I live with on a day-to-day basis, but also with
                my classmates and other pupils with whom I share numerous interests. I am the Head of Charities and
                Sustainability in my house and have organised fundraising events for a wide range of causes, such as
                Bobby’s Fund and Alzheimer’s Research UK.
                In an academic sense, Marlborough has provided a lot of inspiration which has helped me to determine
                what I want to do later in life. For example, a talk given by Dr. Chiara Marletto earlier this year about
                quantum gravity has sparked my interest in more complex branches of quantum and classical physics.  Another talk, this one given by a pupil in my school who
                has taught himself relativity, was also a great joy to attend. It sticks in my mind as a great example of the supportive and collaborative nature
                of this subject at its best, which I hope to experience more widely in the years to come when I study
                physics at university.
                Through living in and studying at Marlborough, my confidence has increased
                immeasurably and has taught me that no aspiration is too high, as long as I work hard enough for it</h4>
