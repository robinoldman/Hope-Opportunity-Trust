        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
        <p>HOT is a Charitable Incorporated Organisation whose mission is to change lives and transform the opportunities available for young people that have extraordinary talent and potential. Our students are young people who have been denied advantage and opportunity but have risen to life’s challenges in a unique and inspiring way. 
            <br><br>
            We are offering students fully funded bursary places at some of the finest schools in the UK. These bursaries are funded by the Royal National Springboard Children’s Foundation and direct funding from the receiving/host schools.  Since 2013 we have realised over £10M of bursary place investment for over 100 students with minimal operating costs.
            <br><br>
            Too many lives are blighted by disadvantage and too much potential is squandered through restricted access to opportunity and education. Every thwarted ambition and every unfulfilled talent diminish and impoverish our communities
            <br><br>
            Our aims are clear and practicable, but their impacts can be incalculable.  Our outputs are transformed lives: nurturing young citizens who will not only reach their individual potential but who are passionate about giving back to their own communities and wider society

            <h3>students A: How I came to Marlborough</h3>
            <a href="pupila.html">
            <h4>After spending most of my childhood in Hungary, I moved to Liverpool with my mum and brother due to challenging family circumstances. Settling in a new country has not always been easy – my mum struggled to find employment when we first came to England but today now works as a care home assistant, something that she loves. I have also, through perseverance, found a path that I love.<br><br>The shift from studying at a state school to living in a boarding school four hours away from home has been a big change. However, it has allowed me to have opportunities - such as a trip to NASA - which I still think of as the best experience of my life. <br><br>On top of that, I have made lifelong friends at Marlborough, not only in my boarding house with the girls I live with on a day-to-day basis, but also with my classmates and other pupils with whom I share numerous interests. I am the Head of Charities and Sustainability in my house and have organised fundraising events for a wide range of causes, such as Bobby’s Fund and Alzheimer’s Research UK.</h4>

            <h3>student A What I got from Marlborough. </h3>
            <h4> In an academic sense, Marlborough has provided a lot of inspiration which has helped me to determine
                what I want to do later in life. For example, a talk given by Dr. Chiara Marletto earlier this year about
                quantum gravity has sparked my interest in more complex branches of quantum and classical physics.<br><br>  Another talk, this one given by a pupil in my school who
                has taught himself relativity, was also a great joy to attend. It sticks in my mind as a great example of the supportive and collaborative nature
                of this subject at its best, which I hope to experience more widely in the years to come when I study
                physics at university.<br><br>
                Through living in and studying at Marlborough, my confidence has increased
                immeasurably and has taught me that no aspiration is too high, as long as I work hard enough for it</h4>

            <h3>student B </h3>
            <h4>I have always lived in Liverpool and grew up in the Kensington/Fairfield area, which was where I attended St. Francis of Assisi secondary school. 
                My sister was the first member of our family to attend university and it was my aspiration to follow her lead. 
                <br><br>
                Boarding school has helped me in a number of different ways. Not only has it provided me with
                an excellent school education, it has also educated me in other areas of life.  The most significant lesson that I took from the experience was that 
                there are no aspirations too high for anyone and this has made me want to push myself to be as successful as possible in the future, something that 
                I previously wouldn’t have had the self-belief and confidence to do.<br><br> Despite all of this, one of the hardest things I learnt whilst at boarding school
                 was that success does not come easy or without hard work. Throughout my experience I had various setbacks and difficulties that I had to overcome.

            <h3>student B</h3>
            <h4>
                This opportunity equally allowed me and my family to meet and make friends with a number of different people from a variety of backgrounds and was 
                very much a new experience for them whilst being a huge part of mine. They had the chance to experience what the boarding school environment was 
                like when attending family events at the school, which was memorable for them and helped to ease any worries that they may have had seeing how at home I was there. 
                <br><br>
                These are friends who come from all walks of life, from different parts of the country to completely different countries, some from more privileged 
                backgrounds than others, but in an environment where none of that mattered and everyone was accepted for who they are. It is through these friendships 
                that since leaving boarding school, I have had the opportunity to travel to places all over the world with this group of friends and have had 
                experiences that I will never forget.

            <h3>studentsr. </h3>
            <h4>
                If I had not attended boarding school I believe my life today would be very different. I think despite my hard-working personality that I may not have 
                pursued the career I am now due to a lack of self-confidence. I wouldn’t have been as well networked as I am now due to the people that I have met 
                through boarding school. I also think that boarding school prepared me for university and working life extremely well, spending two years living with people 
                from different backgrounds and cultures allows you to have an appreciation and understanding of those backgrounds. Boarding school made me a more confident person and put me into situations that I previously wouldn’t have found myself 
                in.<br><br>

                I am currently entering into my 3rd year of study at John Moores University studying Biomedical science. Once I have graduated university, I plan to undergo further study 
                through the NHS Scientist Training Programme, a 3-year programme inclusive of a master’s degree in my chosen area in order to become a fully qualified clinical scientist 
                in the field of reproductive science;  I wouldn’t want to limit myself and what I can achieve. 

                Boarding school was an unforgettable life-changing experience that despite its difficulties was an experience I would urge anyone who gets the opportunity to try to do so. 
                It was not an easy experience by any means, but if it was it wouldn’t be worth it
